# Student Registration System

This project includes a frontend and a backend for a student registration system.

## Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:

- `fronted`: This directory contains the React application for the frontend.
- `student-registration-system-api-backend`: This directory contains the backend API for the system.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `fronted` directory and run `npm install` to install the frontend dependencies (Check Readme of the frontend).
3. Navigate to the `student-registration-system-api-backend` directory and run the necessary commands to set up the backend (Check Read me of backend).
4. Start both the frontend and backend servers.

## Usage

Once both servers are running, you can use the application by opening the frontend in a web browser.
